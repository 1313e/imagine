# IMAGINE

IMAGINE, the **I**nterstellar **MAG**netic Field **IN**ference **E**ngine, 
is an open-source (GNU General Public License v3) software designed for analysing the Galactic components with observables.
It is a modular framework for doing inference on generic (non)parametric models of the Galaxy.
The analysing pipeline works with MPI support and MultiNest sampler.

The Galactic magnetic field (GMF) has a huge impact on the evolution of the Milky Way,
yet currently there exists no standard model for it as its structure is not fully understood.
In the past many parametric GMF models of varying complexity have been developed that 
all have been fitted to an individual set of observational data complicating comparability.

Our goal is to systematize parametric inference of Galactic field models.
We want to enable a statistical comparison of different models in the future, 
allow for simple refitting with respect to newly available data sets and thereby increase the research areaâ€™s transparency.
We aim to make the state-of-art Bayesian methods easily available and in particular to treat the statistics related to the random components of the GMF correctly.
