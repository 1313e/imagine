## IMAGINE examples

- [testing examples](./test_examples) consists of analyses with two simple testing models implemented by the LiSimulator and BiSimulator. Both models are analyzed with MultiNest and Dynesty pipelines.

- [hammurabi examples](./hammurabi_examples) consists of three simple pipeline testings with full-sky regular field synchrotron polarization Q & U maps, partial-sky regular and random field synchrotron polarization Q & U maps. We also provide two python scripts for posterior plotting and analyzing the Spearman correlation among estimated parameters.
